A big thank to thomas15v! The plugin has been entirely rewritten but he was the original creator of this project.

To setup your workspace run `gradle setupServer setupDecompWorkspace`
then add run configurations that points to `run\vanilla\server.jar` and `run\forge\server.jar`
and configure them to run `gradle updatePlugin` before each run.
